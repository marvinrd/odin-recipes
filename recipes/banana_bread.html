        <p>
          This recipe for banana bread yields the moistest, tastiest loaf with a
          ton of banana flavor. Why would you sacrifice banana flavor? My recipe
          is well-liked by family and friends, who deem it to be the best. It is
          delicious when toasted. Enjoy!.

          <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a
            9x5-inch loaf pan.
          </li>

          <li>
            Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Beat brown
            sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a separate large bowl
            until smooth. Stir in eggs and mashed bananas until well blended.
            Stir banana mixture into flour mixture until just combined. Pour
            batter into the prepared loaf pan.
          </li>

          <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the
            center comes out clean, about 60 minutes. Let bread cool in pan for
            10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
          </li>
